                    The name "milk thistle" comes from the milky white sap that flows when the leaves are broken, and the white marbling pattern on its leaves which, according to legend, was caused by drops of the Virgin Mary's milk falling onto the plant.

                    Despite its powerful sleep-promoting effects, valerian's name comes from the Latin word "valere" meaning "to be strong" or "to be healthy." Ironically, while valerian helps humans sleep, cats have the opposite reaction—they become excited and playful when exposed to valerian, similar to their response to catnip!
